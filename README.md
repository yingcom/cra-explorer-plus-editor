Tests are included in the project folder, but not at the demo site above.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/cra-template/template/README.md). Below are commands for some common tasks.  

`yarn` or `npm install` to add the required dependencies.  

`yarn start` or `npm start` to run the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

To make the development server only binds to `localhost`, you can create an `.env` file at the root of the project directory and add `HOST=localhost` in the `.env` file.  

`yarn test` or `npm test` to run tests in the interactive watch mode.  

`yarn build` or `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.  

`yarn serve` or `run run serve` to serve `build` folder.  

`yarn eject` to remove the single build dependency from your project. This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!  

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
